# geojson_to_postgres
Simple script to pass data from geojson to postgresql database


I got a shp from here  https://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/gadm3.6/shp/gadm36_ESP_shp.zip
and then through QGIS desktop I got the geojson file

You can get a shp from another country from here https://www.gadm.org/data.html
